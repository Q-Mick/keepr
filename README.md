# keepr

Keepr is a Picture collecting social site, users can post pictures(Keeps) and they can also create Vaults. Vaults can be public or private, any keep can be stored in a Vault(many to many).
each user has their own profile which has their collection of vaults and keeps which can be viewed by any other user unless it was marked private.

I opted to show Keeps in a masonry grid layout.

Deployed front and backend on an AWS EC2 instance utilizing, UBUNTU, Docker, docker-compose, .NET and NGINX

Frontend - VUE.JS (Composition API), Tailwind CSS - Demonstrated strong frontend fundamentals by creating a responsive layout for whichever device you would like to use to interact with the app.

Achieved - Developed a robust API, with one to many and many to many relationships and user authentication via Auth0.
Backend stack - Leveraged Docker containers for AWS deployment and built the backend using C#, MySQL(AWS RDS Database)
